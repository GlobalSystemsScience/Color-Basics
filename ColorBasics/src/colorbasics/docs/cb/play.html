<h3>Play with Colors Tab Panel</h3>

<p>Two users may play a game together in the Play with Colors tab panel. One user selects a color, and the other must attempt to come as close to it as possible. The level of difficulty indicates the acceptable margin of error, as it is very diffictult to determine exactly the values of any one particular color. The game is also playable against the computer, in which case the computer selects a random color for the user to guess.</p>
