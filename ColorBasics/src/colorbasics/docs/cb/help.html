<h3>Help Menu</h3>

<h4>Open Help as PDF</h4>

<p>If you don't want to or can't open the help file in your browser, you can view the help as a single PDF file. Note that you will need to have a PDF viewer such as <a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Reader</a> installed.</p>

<h4>Open Help in Browser</h4>

<p>View the help files in HTML format in your web browser. The HTML help comes in both a single large file as well as multiple smaller files.</p>

<p>Additionally, menu items exist for accessing specific sections of the help file directly through the browser instead of browsing the table of contents.</p>

<h4>Individual Sections</h4>

<p>If you know what part of the program you need help with, you can directly access individual sections of the help file by selecting one of the options from the help menu.</p>
