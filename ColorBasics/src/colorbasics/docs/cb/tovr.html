<h2>Overview of Tab Panels</h2>

<p>Eight tab panels provide access to a variety of color investigation tools in this program: Intro (Introduction), Compare Colors, Make Colors, Play with Colors, Test Yourself, Color Spaces, Check Display's Color, and About. The Introduction panel provides a brief explanation of how colors are composed. Compare Colors allows you to compare the result of mixing two different colors as both pigments and as light. The input values for three different color spaces can be adjusted in Make Colors to see how colors are composed in each space. Play with Colors contains a color guessing game, playable with either another player or with a computer randomly selecting a color. Test Yourself allows users to check their accuracy at determining colors by eye. The three most commonly used color spaces are explained in detail in Color Spaces. Check Display's Color provides a visual test of the computer/projector display, and About provides information for about the collaborating seven institutions involved in the Measuring Vegetation Health (aka Digital Earth Watch) project.</p>
